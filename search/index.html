The 17 SDGs are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. They cover a broad range of social and economic development issues, with a focus on the most vulnerable and a commitment that “no one will be left behind.” In order to measure and monitor progress on the SDGs, high quality data and information are required. To do this, the government of Canada is launching the SDG data hub, hosted by Statistics Canada.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals Data Hub was announced in the 2018 federal budget. Statistics Canada continues to work with other government departments, Canadians and the private sector to expand coverage and access to data from numerous sources, including international organizations, and to lead the work to develop robust measures in Canada for the Global Indicator Framework for Sustainable Development.\n","id":""},"/sdg-fact-sheets/":{"type":"general.posts","url":"/sdg-fact-sheets/","title":"SDG Fact Sheets\n","content":"On 1 January 2016, the world officially began implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development - the transformative plan of action based on 17 Sustainable Development Goals - to address urgent global challenges over the next 15 years.

They cover a broad range of social, environmental and economic issues, including but not limited to poverty, hunger, health, education, social equality, innovation, climate change, biodiversity and justice, with a focus on the most vulnerable and a commitment to “leave no one behind”. Countries are also encouraged to develop a national implementation plan that can include country-developed indicators to address specific national contexts and priorities to achieving the SDGs.\n\nCanada’s Priorities for Sustainable Development\nTo support Canada’s domestic implementation of the SDGs that the Government of Canada has committed to, a national strategy (Moving forward together: Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy) has been developed. The development of a Canada specific indicator framework was an opportunity to elaborate a set of indicators that aligns more closely with Canada’s domestic priorities related to sustainable development.\n\nThe Canadian Indicator Framework (CIF) encompasses the 17 goals, and adds 33 Canadian Ambitions which have been elaborated by federal departments. In order to report on these Ambitions, Statistics Canada has developed 86 indicators that monitor progress on the National Ambitions and targets. The CIF lays the foundation for Canada to track and report on its progress on the 17 SDGs in the Canadian context.\n\nAbout this website\nStatistics Canada is the central focal point for reporting the data and statistics for both the Canadian and the Global SDG indicators  and has developed this interactive data hub using the Open SDG platform to disseminate the Canadian Indicator Framework data and report on progress towards the Canadian ambitions and targets.\n\nStatistics Canada is continuing to examine data sources that may be useful for reporting on the indicators and over the coming months will continue to add further data disaggregation, statistics, and data visualization features to enhance the experience of users.\n\nStatistics Canada’s SDG team would like to thank everyone that participated in the quality assurance, made suggestions for improvement or contributed in any other way to the creation of this hub.\n\nInterested in more information?\nIf you have further questions, or would like to provide feedback on the SDG Data Hub please contact us.

This includes new data as well as updates to data we have already published. We will continue to incorporate data from existing sources whenever possible.\n\nWhat is the relation between the Canadian Indicator Framework and Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy?\n\nMoving forward together: Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy sets out an approach to accelerate progress towards meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Canada, and contribute to their achievement internationally.\nTo promote engagement and action, the following five core objectives have been identified:\n\n\n  Fostering leadership, governance and policy coherence\n  Raising awareness, engagement and partnerships\n  Accountability, transparency, measurement and reporting\n  Reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples and the 2030 Agenda\n  Investing in the SDGs\nThe Canadian Indicator Framework and the Data hub provides the measurement and reporting necessary to the ensure accountability and transparency crucial to monitor progress towards the achievement of the 17 Goals and 33 Canadian ambitions.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between the Canadian Indicator Framework and the Quality of Life Framework?\n\nThe goal of the SDGs of “leaving no one behind” is a critical call to action for all nations and peoples that will take the effort and contributions of all levels of governments, civil society and individuals.  In complement to Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy: Moving Forward Together and the Canadian Indicator Framework, Budget 2021 introduced Canada’s new Quality of Life Framework, designed to better incorporate quality of life measurements including prosperity, health, environment, social cohesion and good governance into the federal government’s budgeting and policy development.  The framework also focuses on how outcomes are distributed across population sub-groups and on ensuring outcomes are sustainable over time.  While the quality of life framework is derived from evidence on the determinants of well-being, rather than a specific focus on the sustainable development goals and the global challenge for a better and more sustainable future for all, the two frameworks ultimately share a common aim: to encourage transformational social, economic and environmental change to achieve increased quality of life and well-being. These two framework are mutually reinforcing. This means the CIF and the Quality of Life Framework share many common indicators. Jointly, they can help shape future conversations about measuring what matters and taking action to improve the lives of Canadians.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Canadian Indicator Framework and the Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators program?\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals and the Global and Canadian Indicator Frameworks are designed to provide measures of the three pillars of sustainability – society, economy and environment - while the Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators (CESI) program provides data and information to track Canada's performance on key environmental sustainability issues including climate change and air quality, water quality and availability, and protecting nature. CESI is the prime instrument to measure progress of the Federal Sustainable Development Strategy and responds to Environment and Climate Change Canada's commitments under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and the Department of the Environment Act to report to Canadians on the state of the environment.\nNot surprisingly, several of the environmental indicators in the CIF come from the CESI, as these frameworks are complementary.\n\nHow accessible is this website?\n\nOur aim is to make this website as accessible and usable as possible for every user. The Open SDG platform has recently achieved the AA level standard of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1).\n\nWhat browsers can I use to view this website?\n\nOur website works with most of the latest versions of the commonly used browsers. There are some issues with using the site on older versions of browsers (such as IE8) and the Open SDG team is working to fix these.\n\nCan other countries copy this website?\n\nYes. This site is built using the Open SDG platform, which is an open source, free-to-reuse platform for managing and publishing data and statistics related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). See the Open SDG Quick Start guide for technical instructions on the quickest way to get a copy of the Open SDG platform up and running. Countries and localities exploring how to report their own SDGs data can also get support from the Center for Open Data Enterprise (CODE) through their SDG National Reporting Initiative.\n\nWhat is the Canadian Indicator Framework Strategic Review?\n\nStrategic Reviews of the Canadian Indicator Framework occur every three years following the implementation of the framework in 2021. Their purpose is to ensure the continued relevance of the ambitions, targets and indicators while ensuring the alignment of the Canadian Indicator Framework to other related frameworks. As such, strategic reviews will not substantially alter the scope, intent and coherence of the original indicator framework.\n","id":""},"/methodology/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/methodology/","title":"Progress Measurement for Canada’s Sustainable Development Goals\n","content":"Introduction\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a blueprint for improving the economy, society, and the environment in a sustainable manner. At its heart, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people globally can enjoy peace and prosperity.\n\nThe goals are underpinned by a framework of global indicators that allow Canada and other countries to monitor and report on progress. They cover a broad range of social, environmental, and economic issues with a focus on the most vulnerable and a commitment to “leave no one behind”. To complement the global goals, countries are encouraged to develop a national implementation plan that focuses on country-developed indicators to address specific national contexts and priorities to achieve the SDGs.\n\nTo support Canada’s domestic implementation of the SDGs that the Government of Canada has committed to, a national strategy has been established. In addition, the development of a Canadian-specific indicator framework was an opportunity to elaborate on the UN goals with a set of indicators that align more closely with Canada’s domestic priorities related to sustainable development.\n\nMeasuring Progress\nMeasuring and monitoring progress with reliable information is key to understanding how Canada advances toward the achievement of the SDGs.\n\nClosely monitoring the progress of each indicator not only illustrates where Canada is making progress or areas where progress is not being made and Canada can focus its efforts, but also communicates how Canada is doing in an open and transparent manner. A robust measure of progress quantifies an indicator’s progress towards reaching the target in a scientific manner and can used as a tool to better understand success of policies and actions taken to achieve those targets. It can also act as a clear signal to decision-makers to re-adjust or develop effective evidence-based policies to help ensure Canada achieves its targets.\n\nMethodology Adopted\nThe Canadian Indicator Framework (CIF) lays the foundation for Canada to measure and report its progress on the 17 SDGs within the Canadian context. The CIF focuses on Canadian priorities for sustainable development and can be considered a complement to the Global Indicator Framework. In the CIF the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are complemented by 33 ambitions and 86 indicators that are Canadian specific. However, unlike the Global Indicator Framework where every indicator has a target, less than half of the indicators in the CIF currently have a defined target, either quantitative (e.g., target 11.5 By 2030, 22% of commuters use sustainable transportation) or aspirational (e.g., target 5.3 Greater representation of women in leadership roles).\n\nTo complement the CIF, Statistics Canada has developed a robust and simple method of measuring progress which can be reported using visualizations that allow data users to easily see areas of progress or weakness. Even in the absence of specific quantitative targets, an estimate of progress can inform whether undesired trends are being observed by reporting progress deterioration. In essence, this measure of progress provides a simplified illustration of Canada’s progress toward achieving the SDGs, assuming that the current trends are maintained.\n\nRequirements\nStatistics Canada identified essential requirements for the adopted methodology. The guiding principle for the methodology was the necessity of a consistent and easily interpretable measure that could reach a broad audience while maintaining scientific integrity.\n\nMore specifically, the methodology must:\n\n\n  Allow for different data periodicity and timeliness: Data series available in Canada have various collection calendars and reference periods. Some are collected every year while others every few years. Furthermore, the time required between the collection of data and release of official statistics varies greatly between programs.\n  Provide a calculation for measuring progress in the absence of a quantitative target: To gain a greater understanding of policy impacts and progress towards the achievements of the SDGs, it is crucial to be able to assess progress in the absence of a specific numerical target.\n  Allow for the calculation of an aggregate measure, whether at the target, ambition, or goal level: When used appropriately, a composite measure of progress is valuable to leaders and policymakers to help steer policy and actions towards making progress to achieve the SDGs.\n\n\nThe adopted methodology cannot rely on:\n\n\n  The need to create a target when there is none. As a statistical agency, we remain politically neutral. Therefore, it is outside the scope of our mandate to assign targets. Thus, the methodology must be valid even in the absence of a target.\n  Indicator-specific thresholds for progress categories: It was assessed that using different criteria for each indicator would put too much emphasis on the method rather than the message and overall progress. Therefore, the methodology developed uses a straightforward and consistent method across all indicators.\n  The existence of extended time-series: Many issues covered in the SDGs haven’t been measured for an extended period. Opting for a methodology that is robust despite a shorter time-series allows for a considerable increase in the number of indicators for which progress can be calculated.\n  Modelling: Similar to item 3, modelling usually requires a longer time-series which will reduce the number of indicators eligible for calculation of the progress measure.\n\n\nMethodology\nThe progress measure consists of a measure of observed growth compared to an evaluation of the proximity to achieving the target under current conditions. In situations where no quantitative target is provided, the time series is evaluated on the apparent trend of the data.\n\nKeeping in mind the limited number of data points in each time series and a desire to keep the methodology simple and transparent, the optimal methodology for measuring progress closely mirrors the progress methodology used by Eurostat1.\n\nProgress is measured using the growth over the observed period and is calculated by a compound annual growth rate,\n\n\n\nwhere\nCAGRo is the observed compound annual growth rate between t0 and ti   \nyti is the value of the indicator at time ti  \nti is the most recent year where data is available, and  \nt0 is the base year, 2015, unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n\nIndicators with quantitative targets\nIn the case where a quantitative target for the indicator is provided, the observed CAGRo is compared to the theoretical CAGRr, which represents the growth required to achieve the target, by calculating the ratio (Ro/r) as follows:\n\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\nxtT is the target value of the indicator in the target year, tT.\n\nThe result is compared against a set of thresholds2 and assigned a progress category, described below:\n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-fymr{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Ratio of observed over required growth rate\n    Category\n    Symbol\n  \n\n\n  \n    Target is achieved\n    Target achieved\n    \n  \n  \n    Ro/r ≥ 95%\n    On track\n    \n  \n  \n    60% ≤ Ro/r &lt; 95%\n    Progress made but acceleration needed\n    \n  \n  \n    0% ≤ Ro/r &lt; 60%\n    Limited progress\n    \n  \n  \n    Ro/r &lt; 0%\n    Deterioration\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nIndicators without quantitative targets\nIn the case where no quantitative target for a given indicator has been provided, CAGRo is compared to a pre-determined fixed growth rate and the thresholds have been fixed at 0%, 0.5% and 1.5%.\n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-fymr{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Ratio of observed over required growth rate\n    Category\n    Symbol\n  \n\n\n  \n    CAGRo ≥ 1.5%\n    On track\n    \n  \n  \n    0.5% ≤ CAGRo &lt; 1.5%\n    Progress made but acceleration needed\n    \n  \n  \n    0% ≤ CAGRo &lt; 0.5%\n    Limited progress\n    \n  \n  \n    CAGRo &lt; 0%\n    Deterioration\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAggregation at the Goal Level\nTo determine an aggregate level of progress (for example overall progress at the goal level, or if there is more than one indicator for a target or ambition), the methodology developed by Eurostat is once again the preferred methodology.  The progress measure for each indicator is converted into a score, and then averaged at the aggregated level. Each indicator within a goal (or target or ambition) are equi-weighted. The score, both at the indicator and goal/ambition/target level, varies between -5 and 53.\n\n\n\nAggregation for indicators without quantitative targets\nThe scoring function for indicators without a quantitative target is a linear transformation of the CAGR thresholds described above. The cut-off points for a score of ±5 are set to ±2%, as illustrated in Figure 1 below.\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregation for indicators with quantitative targets\nThe scoring function for indicators with a quantitative target reflects the thresholds used to categorize the indicators and uses cut-off values of 130% for a score of +5 and -60% for a score of -5. This is illustrated in Figure 2 below.\n\n\n\nConsiderations and Exceptions\nDue to the nature of the data, a series of considerations and exceptions have been defined:\n\n\n  Should there be no data in 2015, the first available year following 2015 will be used.4  \na. For indicators with a reference period across two years, for example a reference period of April 1, 2015- March 31, 2016:\n   i. The first year is used as the reference period (e.g., if the reference period is 2015-16, then 2015 is used).   \nb. Even when the target results from a policy that was implemented after 2015, the base year for calculating the progress measure will be 2015 when data exists. This aligns with Statistics Canada quality dimensions coherence and comparability.\n  Similar to (1), should the target year be March 20xx, then 20xx-1 will be used as the target year in the calculation since it is the last complete year of data. For example, the year 2022 will be used in the calculation of the progress for an indicator with a target of March 2023.\n  If the target value is zero, it will be replaced by 0.001 in the calculation of the progress measure.\n  In the absence of a specified target date, it is assumed that 2030 is the target period.\n  Should the target year be in the past, the following will be done:\na. Calculate using the methodology with target until the target year (y).\nb. Continue calculating using the methodology with target, keeping the now obsolete target value and year. \nc. Include a note to users explaining how to interpret the information.\nd. Should a new target value and year be introduced, start using the new values in the calculation, and recalculate from y+1.\ne. Include a note to users explaining the change.\n  A minimum of two years of data is required to calculate the progress measure.\n  To calculate the summary measure for a target, ambition or goal, a minimum of 60% of indicators for which it is possible to calculate a progress measure is needed.\n  The progress estimates oversimplify reality. Users should use the progress measure in addition to specific indicator values and other relevant information.\n  The impact of policies takes time to be reflected in the data; the longer the time series, the better the methodology will be to measure progress.\n  The progress measure for indicators that start above the target at their base year for which progress then declines will be automatically overridden to “Deterioration”5.\n  Binary indicators will be assigned one of these 2 categories:\n   a. “Target achieved” if “yes”. \n   b. “Target not achieved” if “no”.\n  For indicators with two targets, for example CIF target 3.9 - By 2025, 95% coverage of all childhood vaccines and 90% coverage of all adolescent vaccines, the result that is the farthest from its target is used as progress measure.\n  Specific exception: CIF indicator 5.4.1 - Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work is reporting the proportion of day spent on unpaid domestic and care work, by sex. To be able to calculate the progress toward the target Equal sharing of parenting roles and family responsibilities, the indicator will be modified prior to calculation. A ratio of the proportion of time for women to that for men will be used, with a desired target of 1.\n\n\nFuture Work\n\nStatistics Canada’s SDG team is working with the Open SDG community to integrate the indicator-level progress measurement into the back end of the Open SDG platform. It will be represented by a label and an icon describing the most recently calculated progress for each indicator. Once implemented, the functionality will be available for all Open SDG users. Due to the complexity of the indicator frameworks, the functionality will only include indicators that report an aggregate value at first – indicators composed solely of sub-components, such as CIF indicator 3.10.1 - Incidence of selected diseases, will require manual calculation and manual input of the progress labels to be displayed on the Open SDG data hub. The Statistics Canada team will continue improving the automatic calculation, as well as developing the aggregate measurement to be integrated into the platform.\n\nMetadata\n\nCanadian Indicator

After assessment, it was found that they are also applicable in the Canadian context. &#8617;\n    \n    \n      For a detailed description of the methodology, please refer to Eurostat (2021), Annex III. &#8617;\n    \n    \n      In very few cases where the periodicity of the data is over 4 years or more, a base period of 2014 has been used. &#8617;\n    \n    \n      This is a necessary measure to counteract a drawback of the formula: In situation where the target was achieved during the base period but deteriorated afterwards, the formula calculates significant progress as the indicator decreases (or increases) more ‘than it should’ to meet the target. Take for example target 3.14 By 2035, less than 5% of Canadians (aged 18+) smoke cigarettes. Suppose that in 2015, 3% of Canadians aged 15+ are cigarette smokers, and that in 2020 this percentage raises to 10%. The formula will calculate the growth required to go from 3% to 5% (instead of the one from 10% to 5%) and will conclude that great progress has been made since the new value not only reached 5% but progressed further ahead to 10%. &#8617;\n    \n  \n\n","id":""},"/related-products/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/related-products/","title":"Related Products\n","content":"As 2030 approaches, Statistics Canada, in collaboration with key partners and stakeholders, will continue to play a critical role in ensuring that policy makers, civil society, the private sector and Canadians have high-quality information to monitor and assess Canada’s progress toward the SDGs.
