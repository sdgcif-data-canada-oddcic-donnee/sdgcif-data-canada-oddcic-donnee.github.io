The 17 SDGs are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. They cover a broad range of social and economic development issues, with a focus on the most vulnerable and a commitment that “no one will be left behind.” In order to measure and monitor progress on the SDGs, high quality data and information are required. To do this, the government of Canada is launching the SDG data hub, hosted by Statistics Canada.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals Data Hub was announced in the 2018 federal budget. Statistics Canada continues to work with other government departments, Canadians and the private sector to expand coverage and access to data from numerous sources, including international organizations, and to lead the work to develop robust measures in Canada for the Global Indicator Framework for Sustainable Development.\n","id":""},"/sdg-fact-sheets/":{"type":"general.posts","url":"/sdg-fact-sheets/","title":"SDG Fact Sheets\n","content":"On 1 January 2016, the world officially began implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development - the transformative plan of action based on 17 Sustainable Development Goals - to address urgent global challenges over the next 15 years.

They cover a broad range of social, environmental and economic issues, including but not limited to poverty, hunger, health, education, social equality, innovation, climate change, biodiversity and justice, with a focus on the most vulnerable and a commitment to “leave no one behind”. Countries are also encouraged to develop a national implementation plan that can include country-developed indicators to address specific national contexts and priorities to achieving the SDGs.\n\nCanada’s Priorities for Sustainable Development\nTo support Canada’s domestic implementation of the SDGs that the Government of Canada has committed to, a national strategy (Moving forward together: Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy) has been developed. The development of a Canada specific indicator framework was an opportunity to elaborate a set of indicators that aligns more closely with Canada’s domestic priorities related to sustainable development.\n\nThe Canadian Indicator Framework (CIF) encompasses the 17 goals, and adds 33 Canadian Ambitions which have been elaborated by federal departments. In order to report on these Ambitions, Statistics Canada has developed 86 indicators that monitor progress on the National Ambitions and targets. The CIF lays the foundation for Canada to track and report on its progress on the 17 SDGs in the Canadian context.\n\nAbout this website\nStatistics Canada is the central focal point for reporting the data and statistics for both the Canadian and the Global SDG indicators  and has developed this interactive data hub using the Open SDG platform to disseminate the Canadian Indicator Framework data and report on progress towards the Canadian ambitions and targets.\n\nStatistics Canada is continuing to examine data sources that may be useful for reporting on the indicators and over the coming months will continue to add further data disaggregation, statistics, and data visualization features to enhance the experience of users.\n\nStatistics Canada’s SDG team would like to thank everyone that participated in the quality assurance, made suggestions for improvement or contributed in any other way to the creation of this hub.\n\nInterested in more information?\nIf you have further questions, or would like to provide feedback on the SDG Data Hub please contact us.

This includes new data as well as updates to data we have already published. We will continue to incorporate data from existing sources whenever possible.\n\nWhat is the relation between the Canadian Indicator Framework and Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy?\n\nMoving forward together: Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy sets out an approach to accelerate progress towards meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Canada, and contribute to their achievement internationally.\nTo promote engagement and action, the following five core objectives have been identified:\n\n\n  Fostering leadership, governance and policy coherence\n  Raising awareness, engagement and partnerships\n  Accountability, transparency, measurement and reporting\n  Reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples and the 2030 Agenda\n  Investing in the SDGs\nThe Canadian Indicator Framework and the Data hub provides the measurement and reporting necessary to the ensure accountability and transparency crucial to monitor progress towards the achievement of the 17 Goals and 33 Canadian ambitions.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between the Canadian Indicator Framework and the Quality of Life Framework?\n\nThe goal of the SDGs of “leaving no one behind” is a critical call to action for all nations and peoples that will take the effort and contributions of all levels of governments, civil society and individuals.  In complement to Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy: Moving Forward Together and the Canadian Indicator Framework, Budget 2021 introduced Canada’s new Quality of Life Framework, designed to better incorporate quality of life measurements including prosperity, health, environment, social cohesion and good governance into the federal government’s budgeting and policy development.  The framework also focuses on how outcomes are distributed across population sub-groups and on ensuring outcomes are sustainable over time.  While the quality of life framework is derived from evidence on the determinants of well-being, rather than a specific focus on the sustainable development goals and the global challenge for a better and more sustainable future for all, the two frameworks ultimately share a common aim: to encourage transformational social, economic and environmental change to achieve increased quality of life and well-being. These two framework are mutually reinforcing. This means the CIF and the Quality of Life Framework share many common indicators. Jointly, they can help shape future conversations about measuring what matters and taking action to improve the lives of Canadians.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Canadian Indicator Framework and the Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators program?\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals and the Global and Canadian Indicator Frameworks are designed to provide measures of the three pillars of sustainability – society, economy and environment - while the Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators (CESI) program provides data and information to track Canada’s performance on key environmental sustainability issues including climate change and air quality, water quality and availability, and protecting nature. CESI is the prime instrument to measure progress of the Federal Sustainable Development Strategy and responds to Environment and Climate Change Canada’s commitments under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and the Department of the Environment Act to report to Canadians on the state of the environment.\n\nNot surprisingly, several of the environmental indicators in the CIF come from the CESI, as these frameworks are complementary.\n\nHow accessible is this website?\n\nOur aim is to make this website as accessible and usable as possible for every user. The Open SDG platform has recently achieved the AA level standard of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1).\n\nWhat browsers can I use to view this website?\n\nOur website works with most of the latest versions of the commonly used browsers. There are some issues with using the site on older versions of browsers (such as IE8) and the Open SDG team is working to fix these.\n\nCan other countries copy this website?\n\nYes. This site is built using the Open SDG platform, which is an open source, free-to-reuse platform for managing and publishing data and statistics related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). See the Open SDG Quick Start guide for technical instructions on the quickest way to get a copy of the Open SDG platform up and running. Countries and localities exploring how to report their own SDGs data can also get support from the Center for Open Data Enterprise (CODE) through their SDG National Reporting Initiative.\n\nWhat is the Canadian Indicator Framework Strategic Review?\n\nStrategic Reviews of the Canadian Indicator Framework occur every three years following the implementation of the framework in 2021. Their purpose is to ensure the continued relevance of the ambitions, targets and indicators while ensuring the alignment of the Canadian Indicator Framework to other related frameworks. As such, strategic reviews will not substantially alter the scope, intent and coherence of the original indicator framework.\n","id":""},"/methodology/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/methodology/","title":"Progress Measurement for Canada’s Sustainable Development Goals\n","content":"Introduction\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a blueprint for improving the economy, society, and the environment in a sustainable manner. At its heart, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people globally can enjoy peace and prosperity.\n\nThe goals are underpinned by a framework of global indicators that allow Canada and other countries to monitor and report on progress. They cover a broad range of social, environmental, and economic issues with a focus on the most vulnerable and a commitment to “leave no one behind”. To complement the global goals, countries are encouraged to develop a national implementation plan that focuses on country-developed indicators to address specific national contexts and priorities to achieve the SDGs.\n\nTo support Canada’s domestic implementation of the SDGs that the Government of Canada has committed to, a national strategy has been established. In addition, the development of a Canadian-specific indicator framework was an opportunity to elaborate on the UN goals with a set of indicators that align more closely with Canada’s domestic priorities related to sustainable development.\n\nMeasuring Progress\nMeasuring and monitoring progress with reliable information is key to understanding how Canada advances toward the achievement of the SDGs.\n\nClosely monitoring the progress of each indicator not only illustrates where Canada is making progress or areas where progress is not being made and Canada can focus its efforts, but also communicates how Canada is doing in an open and transparent manner. A robust measure of progress quantifies an indicator’s progress towards reaching the target in a scientific manner and can be used as a tool to better understand success of policies and actions taken to achieve those targets. It can also act as a clear signal to decision-makers to readjust or develop effective evidence-based policies to help ensure Canada achieves its targets.\n\nMethodology Adopted\nThe Canadian Indicator Framework (CIF) lays the foundation for Canada to measure and report its progress on the 17 SDGs within the Canadian context. The CIF focuses on Canadian priorities for sustainable development and can be considered a complement to the Global Indicator Framework. In the CIF the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are complemented by 33 ambitions and 86 indicators that are Canadian specific. However, unlike the Global Indicator Framework where every indicator has a target, less than half of the indicators in the CIF currently have a defined target, either quantitative (e.g., target 11.5 By 2030, 22% of commuters use sustainable transportation) or aspirational (e.g., target 5.3 Greater representation of women in leadership roles).\n\nTo complement the CIF, Statistics Canada has developed a robust and simple method of measuring progress which can be reported using visualizations that allow data users to easily see areas of progress or weakness. Even in the absence of specific quantitative targets, an estimate of progress can inform whether undesired trends are being observed by reporting progress deterioration. In essence, this measure of progress provides a simplified illustration of Canada’s progress towards achieving the SDGs, assuming that the current trends are maintained.\n\nRequirements\nStatistics Canada identified essential requirements for the adopted methodology. The guiding principle for the methodology was the necessity of a consistent and easily interpretable measure that could reach a broad audience while maintaining scientific integrity.\n\nMore specifically, the methodology must:\n\n\n  Allow for different data periodicity and timeliness: Data series available in Canada have various collection calendars and reference periods. Some are collected every year while others are collected every few years. Furthermore, the time required between the collection of data and release of official statistics varies greatly between programs.\n  Provide a calculation for measuring progress in the absence of a quantitative target: To gain a greater understanding of policy impacts and progress towards the achievements of the SDGs, it is crucial to be able to assess progress in the absence of a specific numerical target.\n  Allow for the calculation of an aggregate measure, whether at the target, ambition, or goal level: When used appropriately, a composite measure of progress is valuable to leaders and policymakers to help steer policy and actions towards making progress to achieve the SDGs.\n\n\nThe adopted methodology cannot rely on:\n\n\n  The need to create a target when there is none. As a statistical agency, we remain politically neutral. Therefore, it is outside the scope of our mandate to assign targets. Thus, the methodology must be valid even in the absence of a target.\n  Indicator-specific thresholds for progress categories: It was assessed that using different criteria for each indicator would put too much emphasis on the method rather than the message and overall progress. Therefore, the methodology developed uses a straightforward and consistent method across all indicators.\n  The existence of extended time series: Many issues covered in the SDGs haven’t been measured for an extended period. Opting for a methodology that is robust despite a shorter time series allows for a considerable increase in the number of indicators for which progress can be calculated.\n  Modelling: Similar to item 3, modelling usually requires a longer time series which will reduce the number of indicators eligible for calculation of the progress measure.\n\n\nMethodology\nThe progress measure consists of a measure of observed growth compared to an evaluation of the proximity to achieving the target under current conditions. In situations where no quantitative target is provided, the time series is evaluated on the apparent trend of the data.\n\nKeeping in mind the limited number of data points in each time series and a desire to keep the methodology simple and transparent, the optimal methodology for measuring progress was inspired by the progress methodology used by Eurostat.1\n\nProgress is measured using the growth over the observed period and is calculated by a compound annual growth rate,\n\n\n\nwhere\nCAGRi is the observed compound annual growth rate between t0 and ti,\nyi is the value of the indicator at time ti,\nti is the most recent year where data is available,\nt0 is the base year, 2015, unless otherwise specified, and\ny0 is the value of the indicator in the base year.\n\nIndicators with quantitative targets\nIn the case where a quantitative target for the indicator is provided, the observed CAGRi is compared to the magnitude of the theoretical CAGRT, which represents the annual growth rate that would be required to achieve the target on time, by calculating the ratio (R) as follows:\n\n\n\nwhere\n\nyT is the target value of the indicator in the target year, tT, and\nd is +1 when the desired progress is in the positive direction and -1 when the desired progress is in the negative direction.\n\nThis formula represents the ratio of the observed growth rate compared to the growth rate required to reach the target while accounting for certain edge cases where the direction to the target differs from the desired direction of progress (e.g., some cases where the base value achieves the target).\n\nThe result is compared against a set of thresholds2 and assigned a progress category as described in the table below:\n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-fymr{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Ratio of observed over required growth rate\n    Category\n    Symbol\n  \n\n\n  \n    Target is achieved\n    Target achieved\n    \n  \n  \n    R &geq; 95%\n    On track\n    \n  \n  \n    60% &leq; R &lt; 95%\n    Progress made but acceleration needed\n    \n  \n  \n    0% &leq; R &lt; 60%\n    Limited progress\n    \n  \n  \n    R &lt; 0%\n    Deterioration\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nIndicators without quantitative targets\nIn the case where no quantitative target for a given indicator has been provided, the observed compound annual growth rate is compared to predetermined fixed growth rates while also accounting for the desired direction of progress.\n\n\n\nThe thresholds are described in the table below:\n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-fymr{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Observed growth rate\n    Category\n    Symbol\n  \n\n\n  \n    CAGR &geq; 1.5% C&ast;\n    On track\n    \n  \n  \n    0.5% C&ast; &leq; CAGR &lt; 1.5% C&ast;\n    Progress made but acceleration needed\n    \n  \n  \n    0% &leq; CAGR &lt; 0.5% C&ast;\n    Limited progress\n    \n  \n  \n    CAGR &lt; 0%\n    Deterioration\n    \n  \n\n\n*The scaling factor C is only applied for indicators with natural limits as defined below. It is a variable between 0 and 1 that reduces thresholds greater than 0% to produce more realistic progress assessments near limits.\n\nIn some cases, indicators may have natural maximum or minimum limits. For example, CIF indicator 9.4.1 Proportion of Canadians that have access to the latest generally deployed mobile wireless technology cannot exceed a maximum limit of 100%. If the value of the indicator in the base year is already near the natural limit, it may be impossible to achieve the growth rates required to attain a progress status of “On track” or “Progress made but acceleration needed” without exceeding the maximum limit of 100%. In these cases, the growth rate thresholds presented in the table are scaled down by a factor that accounts for the base value y0 and natural limit ylim of the indicator. Progress thresholds greater than 0% are reduced by a factor of\n\n\n\nwhere the first case (0 ≤ y0 &lt; ylim) covers situations with a maximum limit and the last two cases cover situations with a minimum limit. The scaling factor, C, is a variable between 0 and 1 that reduces the progress thresholds according to the proximity between the base value and the limit. If the base value is very close to the limit, C will be near zero and will aggressively reduce the thresholds to allow a more realistic range of progress assessments. Alternatively, if the base value is far from the limit, C will be near 1 and will have a minimal impact on the final progress assessment for the indicator.\n\nThe scaling factor defined above was chosen to optimally reduce the progress thresholds in a way that (1) ensures the possibility of attaining a progress status of “On track” without exceeding the limit throughout the first 15 years,3 (2) ensures the reduction factor is identical at equal relative distances from a minimum or a maximum limit, and (3) poses a minimal effect on the thresholds used at intermediate values and those values far away from the limit.4\n\nOnly a limit that affects progress in the desired direction is considered. For example, a maximum limit is not considered for indicators whose desired direction of progress is negative. Also, the scaling factor is not applied to thresholds less than or equal to zero (thresholds ≤ 0%), which represent movement in the inverse direction from the desired direction of progress.\n\nAggregated progress status\nIn some instances, an indicator may not have an explicit headline series or may be composed of many sub-indicators of equal importance. For example, CIF indicator 5.3.1 Proportion of leadership roles held by women provides an assortment of data series for women in various leadership positions. In these situations, the trend of each series is considered in making a final progress assessment for the indicator as a whole.\n\nTo do so, the progress value (R for indicators with quantitative targets and CAGR for indicators without quantitative targets) for each relevant series is converted to a score. The score is obtained from a linear transformation of the progress value to a score that ranges from -5 for indicators showing substantial deterioration to +5 for indicators showing substantial progress (see Figures 1 and 2). The score range is divided equally between all four progress categories: scores between 2.5 and 5 belong to the “On track” category, scores between 0 and 2.5 belong to the “Progress made but acceleration needed” category, scores between -2.5 and 0 belong to the “Limited progress” category, and scores between -5 and -2.5 belong to the “Deterioration” category.\n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-fymr{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Symbol\n    Category\n    Score\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n    Target achieved\n    5*\n  \n  \n    \n    On track\n    [2.5, 5]\n  \n  \n    \n    Progress made but acceleration needed\n    [0, 2.5[\n  \n  \n    \n    Limited progress\n    [-2.5, 0[\n  \n  \n    \n    Deterioration\n    [-5, -2.5[\n  \n\n\n*Only applicable for indicators with quantitative targets. Indicators that achieve the target are automatically assigned a score of 5 regardless of the underlying trend.\n\nFor indicators without quantitative targets, the cut-off thresholds are 2% for a score of +5 and -2% for a score of -5 as illustrated in Figure 1 below. If applicable, thresholds greater than 0% are reduced by the scaling factor C to maintain consistency between scores for indicators with a limit and indicators without a limit.\n\n\n  Figure 1. Score transformation for indicators without quantitative targets\n  \n\n\nFor indicators with quantitative targets, the cut-off thresholds are 130% for a score of +5 and -60% for a score of -5 as illustrated in Figure 2 below.\n\n\n  Figure 2. Score transformation for indicators with quantitative targets\n  \n\n\nThe mean of the progress scores from each series is taken as the overall progress score for the indicator. The aggregate progress status is determined directly from the overall progress score according to the defined ranges of each progress category. For example, the aggregate progress status for an indicator with an overall score of +1 is “Progress made but acceleration needed”.\n\nAny series that achieves its target is automatically assigned a progress score of +5. However, all series must achieve the target for the aggregate progress status to be “Target achieved”.\n\nConsiderations and Exceptions\n\nSpecial considerations for the base value and the target value\nThe progress measurement methodology uses an exponential model to evaluate the growth rate of an indicator observed to date against various thresholds. As an exponential model, it cannot handle cases where either the base value or the target is zero. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, the following replacements are performed automatically:\n\n  If the target value is zero, it is replaced by 0.001 in the calculation of the progress measure.\n  If the base value is zero, it is replaced by 0.001 in the calculation of the progress measure.\n\n\nGenerally, care should be taken to manually select an appropriate replacement value. For example, a target of zero could be replaced by a suitably small number like 1 or 0.001, but the latter is a factor of 1000 smaller than the former, which could significantly impact the final progress assessment.\n\nAnother special consideration for the base value comes when it is exactly equal to the natural limit (y0 = ylim) of an indicator without a quantitative target. In this case, the scaling factor C will be exactly zero, meaning all progress thresholds greater than 0% will be reduced to zero as well. In such a situation, if the calculated progress value is zero or greater (CAGR ≥ 0), the current value is maintained at the limit (or may even exceed the limit) and a progress status of “On track” as well as a score of +5 are assigned to the series. However, if the calculated progress value is negative (CAGR &lt; 0), the progress score and status can be determined as usual.\n\nSpecial considerations for the base year and the target year\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted in 2015 to catalyze progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. As such, the base year is assumed to be 2015 and the target year is assumed to be 2030 unless specified otherwise. Even when the target results from a policy that was implemented after 2015, the base year will be 2015 when data exists unless otherwise specified. This approach ensures coherence and comparability across assessments, in alignment with Statistics Canada’s dimensions of data quality.\n\nShould there be no available data for 2015, the first available year following 2015 will be used. In very few cases where the periodicity of the data is over 4 years or more, a base year of 2014 may be used instead. Additionally, if the reference period spans multiple years, the first year is used as the reference period. For example, the reference period 2015-16 is interpreted as the reference year 2015 in the progress calculation.\n\nMinimum data requirements\nThe data must meet certain requirements in order to produce a progress assessment.\n\n  At least two years of data is required to calculate the progress measure.\n  As the described progress measure methodology is based on an exponential growth model, it is valid only when all values are positive or all values are negative. If all values are negative, the desired direction of progress is flipped in the progress measure calculation.\n\n\nWhen the data for an indicator does not meet these minimum requirements, the progress status will be reported as “Unable to assess”.\n\nIn rare cases, when the relevant experts have determined that a progress assessment would hinder the interpretation of the indicator data, the progress status will instead be reported as “Not available”.\n\nBinary indicators\nBinary indicators are categorized as follows:\n\n  “Target achieved” if all conditions for meeting the target have been met.\n  “Target not achieved” if one or more conditions for meeting the target have not been met.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe progress assessments generated by the outlined methodology oversimplify reality. The methodology may produce better results when applied to indicators demonstrating a trend of continuous exponential growth year after year than when applied to other types of indicators. Results for indicators where the base value or the target value is zero should also be interpreted carefully due to the limitations of the underlying model. Importantly, it takes time for policies to yield measurable results. Users should interpret the reported progress status accordingly, alongside any other relevant contextual information.\n\nSpecific exceptions for the Canadian Indicator Framework\nThe progress measurement methodology allows data to be transformed from an invalid form to an equivalent valid form before the progress calculation.\n\nWhen the stated target is to achieve or promote equal sharing of responsibilities within the household and family, it is interpreted as meaning an equal ratio between the sexes. For example, the data for CIF indicator 5.4.1 Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work is transformed, prior to the progress calculation, into a ratio of the time spent by women on unpaid domestic and care work to that spent by men. The desired progress is a reduction towards a target ratio of 1.\n\nCIF indicator 15.3.1 Canadian Species Index reports the cumulative percent change of the Canadian Species Index since 1970. Cumulative percent change values are unsuitable for the described progress measure methodology because both positive and negative values are allowed. Therefore, the progress measure is calculated by first transforming the indicator data from a relative measure to an absolute one. The base value in 1970 can be set to 1 and the following years’ values are converted by applying the cumulative percent change to this base value. For example, in 2015, the cumulative percent change since 1970 was -6.61%, so 1(1-0.0661) = 0.9399 is taken as the value for 2015 in the progress measure calculation.\n\nCIF indicator 16.4.1 Civil Court case completion time reports progress based on the proportion of cases that are completed in 6 months or less, which is equal to the sum of the percentage of cases completed in less than or equal to 3 months and the percentage of cases completed in greater than 3 months to 6 months. The desired progress is in the positive direction, i.e., to increase the proportion of Civil Court cases that are completed in 6 months or less.\n\nCommunity\n\nThe progress measure methodology described above is applied throughout the Canadian Indicator Framework for the Sustainable Development Goals Data Hub. At a glance, users can interpret indicator-level progress towards Canada’s national sustainable development goals!\n\nStatistics Canada’s SDG team is working with the Open SDG community to integrate the indicator-level progress measurement into the back-end of the Open SDG platform.
