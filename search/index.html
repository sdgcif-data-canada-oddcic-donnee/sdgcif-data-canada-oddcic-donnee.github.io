The 17 SDGs are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. They cover a broad range of social and economic development issues, with a focus on the most vulnerable and a commitment that “no one will be left behind.” In order to measure and monitor progress on the SDGs, high quality data and information are required. To do this, the government of Canada is launching the SDG data hub, hosted by Statistics Canada.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals Data Hub was announced in the 2018 federal budget. Statistics Canada continues to work with other government departments, Canadians and the private sector to expand coverage and access to data from numerous sources, including international organizations, and to lead the work to develop robust measures in Canada for the Global Indicator Framework for Sustainable Development.\n","id":""},"/sdg-fact-sheets/":{"type":"general.posts","url":"/sdg-fact-sheets/","title":"SDG Fact Sheets\n","content":"On 1 January 2016, the world officially began implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development - the transformative plan of action based on 17 Sustainable Development Goals - to address urgent global challenges over the next 15 years.

They cover a broad range of social, environmental and economic issues, including but not limited to poverty, hunger, health, education, social equality, innovation, climate change, biodiversity and justice, with a focus on the most vulnerable and a commitment to “leave no one behind”. Countries are also encouraged to develop a national implementation plan that can include country-developed indicators to address specific national contexts and priorities to achieving the SDGs.\n\nCanada’s Priorities for Sustainable Development\nTo support Canada’s domestic implementation of the SDGs that the Government of Canada has committed to, a national strategy (Moving forward together: Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy) has been developed. The development of a Canada specific indicator framework was an opportunity to elaborate a set of indicators that aligns more closely with Canada’s domestic priorities related to sustainable development.\n\nThe Canadian Indicator Framework (CIF) encompasses the 17 goals, and adds 31 Canadian Ambitions which have been elaborated by federal departments. In order to report on these Ambitions, Statistics Canada has developed 76 indicators that monitor progress on the National Ambitions and targets. The CIF lays the foundation for Canada to track and report on its progress on the 17 SDGs in the Canadian context.\n\nAbout this website\nStatistics Canada is the central focal point for reporting the data and statistics for both the Canadian and the Global SDG indicators  and has developed this interactive data hub using the Open SDG platform to disseminate the Canadian Indicator Framework data and report on progress towards the Canadian ambitions and targets.\n\nStatistics Canada is continuing to examine data sources that may be useful for reporting on the indicators and over the coming months will continue to add further data disaggregation, statistics, and data visualization features to enhance the experience of users.\n\nStatistics Canada’s SDG team would like to thank everyone that participated in the quality assurance, made suggestions for improvement or contributed in any other way to the creation of this hub.\n\nInterested in more information?\nIf you have further questions, or would like to provide feedback on the SDG Data Hub please contact us.

In complement to Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy: Moving Forward Together and the Canadian Indicator Framework, Budget 2021 introduced Canada’s new Quality of Life Framework, designed to better incorporate quality of life measurements including prosperity, health, environment, social cohesion and good governance into the federal government’s budgeting and policy development.  The framework also focuses on how outcomes are distributed across population sub-groups and on ensuring outcomes are sustainable over time.  While the quality of life framework is derived from evidence on the determinants of well-being, rather than a specific focus on the sustainable development goals and the global challenge for a better and more sustainable future for all, the two frameworks ultimately share a common aim: to encourage transformational social, economic and environmental change to achieve increased quality of life and well-being. These two framework are mutually reinforcing. This means the CIF and the Quality of Life Framework share many common indicators. Jointly, they can help shape future conversations about measuring what matters and taking action to improve the lives of Canadians.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Canadian Indicator Framework and the Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators program?\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals and the Global and Canadian Indicator Frameworks are designed to provide measures of the three pillars of sustainability – society, economy and environment - while the Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators (CESI) program provides data and information to track Canada's performance on key environmental sustainability issues including climate change and air quality, water quality and availability, and protecting nature. CESI is the prime instrument to measure progress of the Federal Sustainable Development Strategy and responds to Environment and Climate Change Canada's commitments under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and the Department of the Environment Act to report to Canadians on the state of the environment.\nNot surprisingly, several of the environmental indicators in the CIF come from the CESI, as these frameworks are complementary.\n\nHow accessible is this website?\n\nOur aim is to make this website as accessible and usable as possible for every user. The Open SDG platform has recently achieved the AA level standard of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1).\n\nWhat browsers can I use to view this website?\n\nOur website works with most of the latest versions of the commonly used browsers. There are some issues with using the site on older versions of browsers (such as IE8) and the Open SDG team is working to fix these.\n\nCan other countries copy this website?\n\nYes. This site is built using the Open SDG platform, which is an open source, free-to-reuse platform for managing and publishing data and statistics related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). See the Open SDG Quick Start guide for technical instructions on the quickest way to get a copy of the Open SDG platform up and running. Countries and localities exploring how to report their own SDGs data can also get support from the Center for Open Data Enterprise (CODE) through their SDG National Reporting Initiative.\n","id":""},"/related-products/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/related-products/","title":"Related Products\n","content":"As 2030 approaches, Statistics Canada, in collaboration with key partners and stakeholders, will continue to play a critical role in ensuring that policy makers, civil society, the private sector and Canadians have high-quality information to monitor and assess Canada’s progress toward the SDGs.
