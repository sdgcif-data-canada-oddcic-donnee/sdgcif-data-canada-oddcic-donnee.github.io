        <h1>Progress Measurement for Canada’s Sustainable Development Goals</h1>
        


    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a blueprint for improving the economy, society, and the environment in a sustainable manner. At its heart, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people globally can enjoy peace and prosperity.</p>

<p>The goals are underpinned by a framework of global indicators that allow Canada and other countries to monitor and report on progress. They cover a broad range of social, environmental, and economic issues with a focus on the most vulnerable and a commitment to “leave no one behind”. To complement the global goals, countries are encouraged to develop a national implementation plan that focuses on country-developed indicators to address specific national contexts and priorities to achieve the SDGs.</p>

<p>To support Canada’s domestic implementation of the SDGs that the Government of Canada has committed to, a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/agenda-2030/moving-forward.html">national strategy</a> has been established. In addition, the development of a Canadian-specific indicator framework was an opportunity to elaborate on the UN goals with a set of indicators that align more closely with Canada’s domestic priorities related to sustainable development.</p>

<h2 id="measuring-progress">Measuring Progress</h2>
<p>Measuring and monitoring progress with reliable information is key to understanding how Canada advances toward the achievement of the SDGs.</p>

<p>Closely monitoring the progress of each indicator not only illustrates where Canada is making progress or areas where progress is not being made and Canada can focus its efforts, but also communicates how Canada is doing in an open and transparent manner. A robust measure of progress quantifies an indicator’s progress towards reaching the target in a scientific manner and can be used as a tool to better understand success of policies and actions taken to achieve those targets. It can also act as a clear signal to decision-makers to readjust or develop effective evidence-based policies to help ensure Canada achieves its targets.</p>

<h2 id="methodology-adopted">Methodology Adopted</h2>
<p>The Canadian Indicator Framework (CIF) lays the foundation for Canada to measure and report its progress on the 17 SDGs within the Canadian context. The CIF focuses on Canadian priorities for sustainable development and can be considered a complement to the Global Indicator Framework. In the CIF the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are complemented by 33 ambitions and 86 indicators that are Canadian specific. However, unlike the Global Indicator Framework where every indicator has a target, less than half of the indicators in the CIF currently have a defined target, either quantitative (e.g., target 11.5 <em>By 2030, 22% of commuters use sustainable transportation</em>) or aspirational (e.g., target 5.3 <em>Greater representation of women in leadership roles</em>).</p>

<p>To complement the CIF, Statistics Canada has developed a robust and simple method of measuring progress which can be reported using visualizations that allow data users to easily see areas of progress or weakness. Even in the absence of specific quantitative targets, an estimate of progress can inform whether undesired trends are being observed by reporting progress deterioration. In essence, this measure of progress provides a simplified illustration of Canada’s progress towards achieving the SDGs, assuming that the current trends are maintained.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>Statistics Canada identified essential requirements for the adopted methodology. The guiding principle for the methodology was the necessity of a consistent and easily interpretable measure that could reach a broad audience while maintaining scientific integrity.</p>

<p>More specifically, the methodology must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Allow for different data periodicity and timeliness: Data series available in Canada have various collection calendars and reference periods. Some are collected every year while others are collected every few years. Furthermore, the time required between the collection of data and release of official statistics varies greatly between programs.</li>
  <li>Provide a calculation for measuring progress in the absence of a quantitative target: To gain a greater understanding of policy impacts and progress towards the achievements of the SDGs, it is crucial to be able to assess progress in the absence of a specific numerical target.</li>
  <li>Allow for the calculation of an aggregate measure, whether at the target, ambition, or goal level: When used appropriately, a composite measure of progress is valuable to leaders and policymakers to help steer policy and actions towards making progress to achieve the SDGs.</li>
</ol>

<p>The adopted methodology cannot rely on:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The need to create a target when there is none. As a statistical agency, we remain politically neutral. Therefore, it is outside the scope of our mandate to assign targets. Thus, the methodology must be valid even in the absence of a target.</li>
  <li>Indicator-specific thresholds for progress categories: It was assessed that using different criteria for each indicator would put too much emphasis on the method rather than the message and overall progress. Therefore, the methodology developed uses a straightforward and consistent method across all indicators.</li>
  <li>The existence of extended time series: Many issues covered in the SDGs haven’t been measured for an extended period. Opting for a methodology that is robust despite a shorter time series allows for a considerable increase in the number of indicators for which progress can be calculated.</li>
  <li>Modelling: Similar to item 3, modelling usually requires a longer time series which will reduce the number of indicators eligible for calculation of the progress measure.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>The progress measure consists of a measure of observed growth compared to an evaluation of the proximity to achieving the target under current conditions. In situations where no quantitative target is provided, the time series is evaluated on the apparent trend of the data.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind the limited number of data points in each time series and a desire to keep the methodology simple and transparent, the optimal methodology for measuring progress was inspired by the progress methodology used by Eurostat.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Progress is measured using the growth over the observed period and is calculated by a compound annual growth rate,</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdg-data-canada-odd-donnees/cif-cic_dev/develop/assets/img/methodology/cagr_i.svg" alt="Compound annual growth rate equation" /></p>

<p>where<br />
<em>CAGR</em><sub>i</sub> is the observed compound annual growth rate between <em>t</em><sub>0</sub> and <em>t</em><sub>i</sub>,<br />
<em>y</em><sub>i</sub> is the value of the indicator at time <em>t</em><sub>i</sub>,<br />
<em>t</em><sub>i</sub> is the most recent year where data is available,<br />
<em>t</em><sub>0</sub> is the base year, 2015, unless otherwise specified, and<br />
<em>y</em><sub>0</sub> is the value of the indicator in the base year.</p>

<h4 id="indicators-with-quantitative-targets"><b>Indicators with quantitative targets</b></h4>
<p>In the case where a quantitative target for the indicator is provided, the observed <em>CAGR</em><sub>i</sub> is compared to the magnitude of the theoretical <em>CAGR</em><sub>T</sub>, which represents the annual growth rate that would be required to achieve the target on time, by calculating the ratio (<em>R</em>) as follows:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdg-data-canada-odd-donnees/cif-cic_dev/develop/assets/img/methodology/r.svg" alt="Equation for the ratio of the observed compound annual growth rate to the growth rate required to reach the target on time" /></p>

<p>where<br />
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdg-data-canada-odd-donnees/cif-cic_dev/develop/assets/img/methodology/cagr_t.svg" alt="Equation for the compound annual growth rate required to reach the target on time" /><br />
<em>y</em><sub>T</sub> is the target value of the indicator in the target year, <em>t</em><sub>T</sub>, and<br />
<em>d</em> is +1 when the desired progress is in the positive direction and -1 when the desired progress is in the negative direction.</p>

<p>This formula represents the ratio of the observed growth rate compared to the growth rate required to reach the target while accounting for certain edge cases where the direction to the target differs from the desired direction of progress (e.g., some cases where the base value achieves the target).</p>

<p>The result is compared against a set of thresholds<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> and assigned a progress category as described in the table below:</p>

<p>*<em>The scaling factor C is only applied for indicators with natural limits as defined below. It is a variable between 0 and 1 that reduces thresholds greater than 0% to produce more realistic progress assessments near limits.</em></p>

<p>In some cases, indicators may have natural maximum or minimum limits. For example, CIF indicator 9.4.1 <em>Proportion of Canadians that have access to the latest generally deployed mobile wireless technology</em> cannot exceed a maximum limit of 100%. If the value of the indicator in the base year is already near the natural limit, it may be impossible to achieve the growth rates required to attain a progress status of “On track” or “Progress made but acceleration needed” without exceeding the maximum limit of 100%. In these cases, the growth rate thresholds presented in the table are scaled down by a factor that accounts for the base value <em>y</em><sub>0</sub> and natural limit <em>y</em><sub>lim</sub> of the indicator. Progress thresholds greater than 0% are reduced by a factor of</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdg-data-canada-odd-donnees/cif-cic_dev/develop/assets/img/methodology/coeff.svg" alt="Scaling factor equation" /></p>

<p>where the first case (0 ≤ <em>y</em><sub>0</sub> &lt; <em>y</em><sub>lim</sub>) covers situations with a maximum limit and the last two cases cover situations with a minimum limit. The scaling factor, <em>C</em>, is a variable between 0 and 1 that reduces the progress thresholds according to the proximity between the base value and the limit. If the base value is very close to the limit, <em>C</em> will be near zero and will aggressively reduce the thresholds to allow a more realistic range of progress assessments. Alternatively, if the base value is far from the limit, <em>C</em> will be near 1 and will have a minimal impact on the final progress assessment for the indicator.</p>

<p>The scaling factor defined above was chosen to optimally reduce the progress thresholds in a way that (1) ensures the possibility of attaining a progress status of “On track” without exceeding the limit throughout the first 15 years,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> (2) ensures the reduction factor is identical at equal relative distances from a minimum or a maximum limit, and (3) poses a minimal effect on the thresholds used at intermediate values and those values far away from the limit.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Only a limit that affects progress in the desired direction is considered. For example, a maximum limit is not considered for indicators whose desired direction of progress is negative. Also, the scaling factor is not applied to thresholds less than or equal to zero (thresholds ≤ 0%), which represent movement in the inverse direction from the desired direction of progress.</p>

<h4 id="aggregated-progress-status"><b>Aggregated progress status</b></h4>
<p>In some instances, an indicator may not have an explicit headline series or may be composed of many sub-indicators of equal importance. For example, CIF indicator 5.3.1 <em>Proportion of leadership roles held by women</em> provides an assortment of data series for women in various leadership positions. In these situations, the trend of each series is considered in making a final progress assessment for the indicator as a whole.</p>

<p>To do so, the progress value (<em>R</em> for indicators with quantitative targets and <em>CAGR</em> for indicators without quantitative targets) for each relevant series is converted to a score. The score is obtained from a linear transformation of the progress value to a score that ranges from -5 for indicators showing substantial deterioration to +5 for indicators showing substantial progress (see Figures 1 and 2). The score range is divided equally between all four progress categories: scores between 2.5 and 5 belong to the “On track” category, scores between 0 and 2.5 belong to the “Progress made but acceleration needed” category, scores between -2.5 and 0 belong to the “Limited progress” category, and scores between -5 and -2.5 belong to the “Deterioration” category.</p>

<p>*<em>Only applicable for indicators with quantitative targets. Indicators that achieve the target are automatically assigned a score of 5 regardless of the underlying trend.</em></p>

<p>For indicators without quantitative targets, the cut-off thresholds are 2% for a score of +5 and -2% for a score of -5 as illustrated in Figure 1 below. If applicable, thresholds greater than 0% are reduced by the scaling factor <em>C</em> to maintain consistency between scores for indicators with a limit and indicators without a limit.</p>

<p>The mean of the progress scores from each series is taken as the overall progress score for the indicator. The aggregate progress status is determined directly from the overall progress score according to the defined ranges of each progress category. For example, the aggregate progress status for an indicator with an overall score of +1 is “Progress made but acceleration needed”.</p>

<p>Any series that achieves its target is automatically assigned a progress score of +5. However, all series must achieve the target for the aggregate progress status to be “Target achieved”.</p>

<h3 id="considerations-and-exceptions">Considerations and Exceptions</h3>

<h4 id="special-considerations-for-the-base-value-and-the-target-value"><b>Special considerations for the base value and the target value</b></h4>
<p>The progress measurement methodology uses an exponential model to evaluate the growth rate of an indicator observed to date against various thresholds. As an exponential model, it cannot handle cases where either the base value or the target is zero. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, the following replacements are performed automatically:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If the target value is zero, it is replaced by 0.001 in the calculation of the progress measure.</li>
  <li>If the base value is zero, it is replaced by 0.001 in the calculation of the progress measure.</li>
</ol>

<p>Generally, care should be taken to manually select an appropriate replacement value. For example, a target of zero could be replaced by a suitably small number like 1 or 0.001, but the latter is a factor of 1000 smaller than the former, which could significantly impact the final progress assessment.</p>

<p>Another special consideration for the base value comes when it is exactly equal to the natural limit (<em>y</em><sub>0</sub> = <em>y</em><sub>lim</sub>) of an indicator without a quantitative target. In this case, the scaling factor <em>C</em> will be exactly zero, meaning all progress thresholds greater than 0% will be reduced to zero as well. In such a situation, if the calculated progress value is zero or greater (<em>CAGR</em> ≥ 0), the current value is maintained at the limit (or may even exceed the limit) and a progress status of “On track” as well as a score of +5 are assigned to the series. However, if the calculated progress value is negative (<em>CAGR</em> &lt; 0), the progress score and status can be determined as usual.</p>

<h4 id="special-considerations-for-the-base-year-and-the-target-year"><b>Special considerations for the base year and the target year</b></h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a> was adopted in 2015 to catalyze progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. As such, the base year is assumed to be 2015 and the target year is assumed to be 2030 unless specified otherwise. Even when the target results from a policy that was implemented after 2015, the base year will be 2015 when data exists unless otherwise specified. This approach ensures coherence and comparability across assessments, in alignment with Statistics Canada’s dimensions of data quality.</p>

<p>Should there be no available data for 2015, the first available year following 2015 will be used. In very few cases where the periodicity of the data is over 4 years or more, a base year of 2014 may be used instead. Additionally, if the reference period spans multiple years, the first year is used as the reference period. For example, the reference period 2015-16 is interpreted as the reference year 2015 in the progress calculation.</p>

<h4 id="minimum-data-requirements"><b>Minimum data requirements</b></h4>
<p>The data must meet certain requirements in order to produce a progress assessment.</p>
<ol>
  <li>At least two years of data is required to calculate the progress measure.</li>
  <li>As the described progress measure methodology is based on an exponential growth model, it is valid only when all values are positive or all values are negative. If all values are negative, the desired direction of progress is flipped in the progress measure calculation.</li>
</ol>

<p>When the data for an indicator does not meet these minimum requirements, the progress status will be reported as “Unable to assess”.</p>

<p>In rare cases, when the relevant experts have determined that a progress assessment would hinder the interpretation of the indicator data, the progress status will instead be reported as “Not available”.</p>

<h4 id="binary-indicators"><b>Binary indicators</b></h4>
<p>Binary indicators are categorized as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>“Target achieved” if all conditions for meeting the target have been met.</li>
  <li>“Target not achieved” if one or more conditions for meeting the target have not been met.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="interpretation"><b>Interpretation</b></h4>
<p>The progress assessments generated by the outlined methodology oversimplify reality. The methodology may produce better results when applied to indicators demonstrating a trend of continuous exponential growth year after year than when applied to other types of indicators. Results for indicators where the base value or the target value is zero should also be interpreted carefully due to the limitations of the underlying model. Importantly, it takes time for policies to yield measurable results. Users should interpret the reported progress status accordingly, alongside any other relevant contextual information.</p>

<h4 id="specific-exceptions-for-the-canadian-indicator-framework"><b>Specific exceptions for the Canadian Indicator Framework</b></h4>
<p>The progress measurement methodology allows data to be transformed from an invalid form to an equivalent valid form before the progress calculation.</p>

<p>When the stated target is to achieve or promote equal sharing of responsibilities within the household and family, it is interpreted as meaning an equal ratio between the sexes. For example, the data for CIF indicator 5.4.1 Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work is transformed, prior to the progress calculation, into a ratio of the time spent by women on unpaid domestic and care work to that spent by men. The desired progress is a reduction towards a target ratio of 1.</p>

<p>CIF indicator 15.3.1 <em>Canadian Species Index</em> reports the cumulative percent change of the Canadian Species Index since 1970. Cumulative percent change values are unsuitable for the described progress measure methodology because both positive and negative values are allowed. Therefore, the progress measure is calculated by first transforming the indicator data from a relative measure to an absolute one. The base value in 1970 can be set to 1 and the following years’ values are converted by applying the cumulative percent change to this base value. For example, in 2015, the cumulative percent change since 1970 was -6.61%, so 1(1-0.0661) = 0.9399 is taken as the value for 2015 in the progress measure calculation.</p>

<p>CIF indicator 16.4.1 <em>Civil Court case completion time</em> reports progress based on the proportion of cases that are completed in 6 months or less, which is equal to the sum of the percentage of cases completed in less than or equal to 3 months and the percentage of cases completed in greater than 3 months to 6 months. The desired progress is in the positive direction, i.e., to increase the proportion of Civil Court cases that are completed in 6 months or less.</p>

<p>The progress measure methodology described above is applied throughout the Canadian Indicator Framework for the Sustainable Development Goals Data Hub. At a glance, users can interpret indicator-level progress towards Canada’s national sustainable development goals!</p>

<p>Statistics Canada’s SDG team is working with the <a href="https://open-sdg.org/">Open SDG</a> community to integrate the indicator-level progress measurement into the back-end of the Open SDG platform. The official release of the progress measurement functionality is coming soon with the launch of Open SDG 2.4.0.</p>
